The main reason for creating this project was to develop the Web Store - a Japanese food delivery store, "Sushi Cat". First of all, the functionality of this website implies the possibility of ordering Japanese cuisine dishes and obtaining background information on the range of dishes and prices for them. The second part was administrator access to the background office for further manipulations with the goods.

Work plan:
1) Description and development of requirements for the basics of the business process of the Internet resource.
2) Implementation of the choice of resource development technologies (programming language, database, etc.).
3) Creation of a site development plan, task prioritization, etc.
4) Development
5) Functional testing

Let's take a closer look at each of these points:
1) The main requirement for resource functionality is the ability to get acquainted with the list of premade dishes with the subsequent order of products.
2) To develop this resource, I will use the following technologies:
a) PHP for describing the logic and backend of the site
b) MySql as DB
c) JavaScript - for developing custom functionality
d) HTML and CSS - for layout.
3) For development, I will use the following technologies:
a) Website layout HTML, CSS
b) Website logic development (PHP, OS)
c) Testing and debugging

Main part:
This web resource will demonstrate and sell ready-made Japanese cuisine dishes provided in the Sushi Cat online store, with the possibility of subsequent ordering. The purpose of this site is to increase the profit of the Sushi Bar through sales via the Internet.
The work of the web application begins with entering this portal, where a potential buyer can get acquainted with the list of dishes and subsequently place an order.
There are three parts of development process. The first consisted of laying out a static table using HTML and CSS. Second, I described the backend - logic. For this, I used PHP. And third, Assets are accessed through queries in the database.
